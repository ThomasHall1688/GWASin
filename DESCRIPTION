Description: This package determines the significance of the distribution of SNP nominal P values within 
             and up to (start_pos + (interval X interval_jumps))kb up and downstream to each gene of interest 
             suspected to have an effect on GWAS phenotype. A total of (permutations) random samplings (with replacement) 
             from the a GWAS P value data set  representing the size of each of selected SNP subsets will be generated. 
             The q values for each SNP P value subset and all its permuted equivalents are calculated using the qvalue 
             library in R, a package incorporated into the GWASin library. The subsequent significance level (Pperm) 
             assigned to each of the SNP subsets is equivalent to the proportion of permutations in which at least the 
             same number of q values < 0.05/0.1 as the SNP subset were obtained, i.e. by chance. The package will create two directories and output three main data types : Extracted_SNPS which will contain 
             all the SNPs extracted from each gene in single column text files. The second directory will be Integration_output,
             and will contain a text file containing all extracted SNPs with the orginal pvalues and qvalues along side the 
             new permuted qvalues. It will also contain histograms plotting the distributions of SNPs with qvalues < 0.05/0.1.
             Finally, a summary text file will contain information about each SNP file analysed, containing the file name, total SNP amount,
             amount of SNPs with an original qvalue < 0.05, amount of SNPs with a new qvalue < 0.05, the probability these new
             qvalues are by chance (0 - 100%), average number of SNPs per (permutations) set that had a new qvalue < 0.05, 
             amount of SNPs with an original qvalue < 0.1, amount of SNPs with a new qvalue < 0.1, the probability these new
             qvalues are by chance (0 - 100%), average number of SNPs per (permutations) set that had a new qvalue < 0.1.
